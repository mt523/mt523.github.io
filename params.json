Officially, OS X is the only supported operating system for development, but if you're running Windows you're not entirely out of luck, thanks to the combined efforts of other Windows users. Listed below are the steps that have worked for me in order to get my Windows development environment up and running.\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\nIf you've done any previous Android development, you should already have most of this set up.\r\n* [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)\r\n* [Latest JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)\r\n* [Latest version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) \r\n* ANDROID_HOME environment variable with the correct path to your SDK\r\n\r\n### Setting up the emulator\r\nYou'll need to create an Android emulator to run the React Native project we'll create later, along with the latest SDK platform, which at the time of writing this was API 23. Simply follow the steps outlined in React Native's [Android Setup](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/android-setup.html#content) guide.\r\n\r\n### Installing the React Native packages\r\nAfter installing Node, we can use the Node Package Manager to install the React Native packages:\r\n\r\n    npm install react-native-cli\r\n\r\nAnd that's it, you're ready to get going.\r\n\r\n### Creating a new project\r\nCreate a new directory for your new project with any name you like. From inside this directory, run the following command:\r\n    \r\n    react-native init (your project name) \r\n\r\n### Modifying the generated code for Windows\r\nAll credit here goes to GitHub user \"mqli\" for figuring out this hack work around running the bash files. In your newly created project, follow the [instructions on mqli's Gist.](https://gist.github.com/mqli/e1e6576e9838d885a43a)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we need to fix a potential infinite loop that emerges as a side effect of running on Windows. As of now, there is a [pull request](https://github.com/mqli/react-native/commit/f5314afc7b69c9489c4f095dbd4d03d26ede9b46) that shows the changes that need to be made.\r\n\r\n### Run the project\r\nYou're ready to go. Start your emulator, and run the following commands from your new project's root directory.\r\n\r\nStart the webserver\r\n\r\n    react-native start\r\n\r\nRun the project\r\n\r\n    react-native run-android\r\n\r\nYou should now be greeted by the Welcome to React Native screen. \r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/nYrSGww.png?1)\r\n\r\nFor more information, visit the [React Native documentation and tutorials](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial.html#content).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
